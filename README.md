# TapEm
Simple, two-player Android game - Tap the squares faster than your opponent!

TapEm is an Android app I created for my senior project at UNG that utelizes multithreading and socket communication to update both players' scores in real time as the game progresses. 

## Build
To build this app in Android Studio, simply clone this repository and import it as a new Android Studio project. You may then compile and run it on either an emulator or physical device.
